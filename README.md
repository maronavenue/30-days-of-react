# 30 Days of React

## Lab 1 - Base syntax
### Checklist
  1. Create two new **components**: UserInput and UserOutput
  1. Use `props` and `state` (pre-React 16.8, don't use React hooks yet)
  1. Pass `username` as state and apply **state management** via an event handler method
  1. Apply **two-way data binding** so `username` gets reflected always
  1. Apply CSS stylesheet and inline styling across the components
